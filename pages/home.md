### Welcome
The biggest room on earth is the room for improvement; the space to continuously refine and improve the existing social and technological structures of a community. 

1. In agreement with this truism, The MEB Project aims at mobilising human and material resources to support the election of Senator Ike Ekweremadu (Ikeoha Ndigbo) as the governor of Enugu State in 2023.

2. The MEB Project recognises the efforts made so far by the current administration in Enugu State, but believes that a lot more could have been done with the resources available to it.

3. The MEB Project further believes that the sterling records of Senator Ike Ekweremadu (Ikeoha Ndigbo) in public office are an indication that he can truly make Enugu better if he leads the state.

4. This invitation, therefore, is for people who share the above beliefs of The MEB Project, and who can commit to the achievement of the primary objective.
